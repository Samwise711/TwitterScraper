# TwitterScraper
This program, for windows machines, uses AI to scrape qualified email address leads from any Twitter handle.

HOW TO OPERATE:
1) Download the folder "lead_widget" then run the "lead_widget.exe" file to start the program
2) Copy and paste your Twitter API keys, or create them (from: https://apps.twitter.com/), input them in the respective fields and "Save"
3) The main program window will open. Here you can input any Twitter handle for which you want to scrape email addresses, hit "Export" to begin scraping
4) You can "Stop" scraping at anytime and this will generate a .csv in the "lead_widget" root folder, with the compiled emails
5) You can also "Pause" during scraping (i.e. if you need to shut down your computer, or change wifi networks)
  a) this means you can pick up scraping where you left off just by pressing any key in the accompanying terminal console window
6) Enjoy!!
